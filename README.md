## BDD Specs

### Story: Customer requests to see their image feed

### Narrative #1

```
As an online customer
I want the app to automatically load my latest image feed
So I can always enjoy the newest images of my friends
```

#### Scenarios (Acceptance criteria)

```
Given the customer has connectivity
 When the customer requests to see their feed
 Then the app should display the latest feed from remote
  And replace the cache with the new feed
```

### Narrative #2

```
As an offline customer
I want the app to show the latest saved version of my image feed
So I can always enjoy images of my friends
```

#### Scenarios (Acceptance criteria)

```
 Given the customer doesn't have connectivity
   And there’s a cached version of the feed
   And the cache is less than seven days old
  When the customer requests to see the feed
  Then the app should display the latest feed saved

 Given the customer doesn't have connectivity
   And there’s a cached version of the feed
   And the cache is seven days old or more
  When the customer requests to see the feed
  Then the app should display an error message

 Given the customer doesn't have connectivity
   And the cache is empty
  When the customer requests to see the feed
  Then the app should display an error message
```
